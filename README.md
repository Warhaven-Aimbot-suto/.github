## 🎯 What Is a Warhaven Aimbot?

An aimbot is a precision-based cheat that auto-locks your attacks onto enemies. It helps you hit heads, soft-lock moving targets, and execute **flawless shots** during even the most chaotic clashes.

In Warhaven’s high-speed 6v6 chaos, this means the difference between a 1v3 clutch and a respawn countdown. 💀🕹️
